# AIR RISK AI – City Pollution Risk Detector & Eco Recommendation Platform

## Problem statement

### Air pollution is increasing rapidly in many Indian cities, but citizens and local authorities often don’t know:

Which city is becoming more risky day-by-day

What pollutants are responsible (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, O₃, SO₂, CO)

How the pollution trend is changing (increasing or decreasing)

What actions should be taken to reduce pollution and protect health

Because of this lack of real-time awareness and insights, people continue daily life without precautions, and cities fail to take timely preventive steps.

### Key Features

✅ City-based pollution monitoring using latitude & longitude
✅ Pollution Risk Score calculation based on major pollutants
✅ High Risk city detection and trend-based alerting
✅ Pollution visualization using graphs/pie charts
✅ Environment-friendly recommendations for citizens, industries, and government

### Impact / Why it matters

This solution helps:

Citizens take precautions (mask, avoid outdoor activity, reduce emissions)

Authorities identify critical cities faster and plan action

Communities adopt eco-friendly habits to reduce pollution growth

### Instead of just displaying data, the system adds intelligence by:

Generating a risk score from pollutant values

Categorizing the city as Safe / Moderate / Risk / High Risk ↑

Providing recommended environment-friendly actions based on risk category
